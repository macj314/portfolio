          <p>Hello, my name is Jason Macie. Welcome to my portfolio. There are known-knowns: things that we know that we know. Scientific practices and the laws of nature
            are a couple examples. Coversly, there are known-unknowns: things that we know that we don't know. There are so many planets and extraterestrial beings that escape
            our view and understanding currently. Almost even scarier are the things that we don't know in the deepest parts of our own cosmic home. There are uknown-uknowns
            Things that we don't know that we don't know. Finally there are uknown-knowns: Things that we don't know that we know.
